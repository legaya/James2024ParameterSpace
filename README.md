# James2024ParameterSpace

This repository contains all the codes used for Legay et al. "A framework for assessing ocean mixed layer depth evolution". 
It includes the Jupyter Notebook used for performing the 1D simulations and all the analyses ("AnalysesParameterSpace.pynb"), the 1D model as a Fortran Module "scm_oce.so", and the Fortran codes needed for generating this module (in the folder "scm_oce"). 
The eORCA1, eORCA1GM, eORCA12 and eNATL60 simulations outputs needed for realizing the figures are available as netCDF files and "npz" archives via the following DOI: [https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10423178](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.11236177).
